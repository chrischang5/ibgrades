# IB Grades React App

This project is provides a way for IB students to view and visualize historical International Baccalaureate (IB) grade distributions. Currently, it's a proof of concept with data only available for May 2019 and May 2018.
This project was built using React, HTML, Bootstrap CSS, Chart.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Excel, and Python.

# Features


# Data Source
The grade distribution data comes directly from the May and November releases of the Diploma Programme (DP) Statistical Bulletins. These bulletins can be found on [IBO's DP statistical bulletin page](https://www.ibo.org/about-the-ib/facts-and-figures/statistical-bulletins/diploma-programme-statistical-bulletin/).
A repository containing the PDFs and CSV versions will also be available soon.

This project is in no way affiliated with IBO or the IB Programme.
